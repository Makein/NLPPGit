Nene
……What？ Right now, I'd like you to leave me alone for a bit……
Nene
Hmm？ Are you finally ready to apologize？
Nene
I don't want to stay mad at each other. I want to make up……
Nene
Today is my birthday. You remembered, right？
Nene
It's my birthday today, so make sure to celebrate, okay？
Nene
It's my birthday today. Hehe, I'm looking forward to it.
Nene
Hey, is it something you forget about your girlfriend's birthday？ ……Sigh.
Nene
Did you forget your girlfriend's birthday？ Are you disqualified as a boyfriend now？
Nene
You forgot my birthday？ I felt lonely……
Nene
It's your birthday, congratulations. Hehe, I'm glad I could say it.
Nene
Happy birthday. Can I be a bit more spoiled today？
Nene
Happy birthday!! ……Did I get a little too excited？
Nene
I wanted to celebrate your birthday if possible……
Nene
Since I'm your girlfriend, I wanted to celebrate your birthday.
Nene
Your birthday has passed. Let's spend it together next year, okay？
Nene
Do you remember？ Today is the day we first met.
Nene
Today is the day we first met, remember？
Nene
Today is the day we first met. Don't ever forget.
Nene
Today is the day we started dating, right？
Nene
Today is the anniversary of when we started dating. Remember it from now on.
Nene
Do you remember？ Today is the day we started going out together.
Nene
Today is the day we first kissed…… right？
Nene
Hehe. Today is the anniversary of the first time we kissed…… Do you remember？
Nene
Today is a very special anniversary, the anniversary of our first kiss.
Nene
Monday. Well, let's do our best for another week.
Nene
Tuesday. Hmm, still a bit groggy from the break？
Nene
Wednesday, a bit of a midweek slump. No, no, we have to do our best.
Nene
Thursday. Do you have any plans for the weekend？
Nene
Friday. The week is almost over again.
Nene
It's Saturday. Weekends always make me a little excited.
Nene
It's Saturday. Good job on another week.
Nene
Hehe, it's Sunday. What are you going to do？
Nene
Sunday. There are so many things I want to do.
Nene
Hey, hey. Do you know what "yukikusa" means？
Nene
Ah, it's so warm and pleasant today. Sigh……
Nene
Hmm~, it's summer.
Nene
It's hot today, but hang in there.
Nene
They say love that starts in autumn has a deeper bond. What do you think？
Nene
I kinda like the sound of insects in this season.
Nene
It's cold, isn't it？ I feel like having a warm stew.
Nene
Are you dressed warmly？ Don't catch a cold.
Nene
Happy New Year. Um…… it's a little embarrassing to say it.
Nene
I had a wonderful first dream. It's a secret what it was about.
Nene
First dream？ Hehe, do you want to know？ Hey, do you want to know？
Nene
Of course, you appeared in my first dream. What about you？
Nene
How was your winter break？
Nene
Celosia, Nasturtium, Marigold…… um, what else was there？
Nene
Coming-of-age ceremony. Both furisode and hakama are nice, right…… hehe, which one do you prefer？
Nene
Well, the New Year's mood ends today!
Nene
It's Setsubun, huh？ I wonder why demons are scared of beans.
Nene
According to the calendar, it's spring from today. It's still a bit cold though.
Nene
The Kunitsukuri myth is a bit embarrassing, isn't it……？
Nene
Ah, finally, this day has come. I'm getting nervous.
Nene
Valentine's Day, huh？ What should I do…… hehe, what do you want？
Nene
Well, it's finally the day. Be prepared! ……hehe.
Nene
It's March now, right…… Huh？ Am I wrong？
Nene
Plum blossoms are beautiful, aren't they……？
Nene
Today is Girls' Day, so be extra kind. Hehe.
Nene
What day is it today…… Nah, it's nothing.
Nene
Hehe. Today is White Day. I wonder what you'll do for me？
Nene
Triple the return is the basic rule. So let's spend three times more time together.
Nene
Today is the Vernal Equinox, a day perfectly divided in the middle. But it's spring, so I feel sleepy from noon……
Nene
Hehe, it's almost spring break, right？
Nene
Spring break starts today. What should we do first？
Nene
I'm actually going away for a while…… Ah, just kidding, okay？
Nene
You're such a big…… No, I can't even say something like that, even as a joke.
Nene
Actually, I'm much older…… Do you believe me？
Nene
Oh, spring break went by so fast. I wish I could have played a little longer.
Nene
The season of cherry blossoms, it lifts your spirits, doesn't it？
Nene
Today is Showa Day. Um, what was it originally……？
Nene:
Golden Week is coming up soon. I wonder how many consecutive holidays we'll have this year. Let's see, one…… two……
Nene:
Constitution Memorial Day, huh？ I'm not quite sure what that is.
Nene:
Today is Greenery Day. How about spending some time outside and relaxing？
Nene:
Oh, look, koinobori (carp streamers). How long did you used to fly them for？
Nene:
According to the calendar, today marks the beginning of summer. I'm looking forward to it.
Nene:
Hey, hey. The flower shop was filled with carnations.
Nene:
Sports festival, huh？ Feeling a bit gloomy about it.
Nene:
The longest daytime of the year. It feels like a good deal, doesn't it？
Nene:
Time to switch to short sleeves starting today. It feels a bit lighter.
Nene:
Father's Day gift. Last year was a tie, the year before was cufflinks…… What should I do this year？
Nene:
It's time for the beach to open. I hope I can go to the sea this year too.
Nene:
Orihime-sama and Hikoboshi-san…… I wonder if they'll meet properly this year？
Nene:
Summer vacation is almost here. But remember, it's not good to just play around.
Nene:
It's Marine Day. Here we go!
Nene:
Long, long summer vacation starts from today. What should I do？
Nene:
On the calendar, today marks the beginning of autumn. But it's still hot, isn't it？
Nene:
Fireworks season, huh？ I wonder if I'll be able to go and see them this year.
Nene:
It's Obon. Maybe it'll get a little cooler after this.
Nene:
Summer vacation is over today. Have you finished your homework properly？
Nene:
Autumn equinox. A day where the day and night are divided equally.
Nene:
Respect for the Aged Day. When I grow old, I want to become a lovely grandma too.
Nene:
Today is the autumnal equinox, a day where the day is divided in the middle.
Nene:
Time to switch to winter clothes starting today. But it's still a bit hot, isn't it？
Nene:
Did you know that there are countries where there's a crab on the moon instead of a rabbit？ Imagination is amazing, isn't it……？
Nene:
Trick or treat! Hehe. If you don't give me candy, I'll play a prank on you!
Nene:
Culture Day. How about doing some reading today？
Nene:
It's not that cold yet, but according to the calendar, today marks the beginning of winter.
Nene:
Shichi-Go-San (Seven-Five-Three). When I was a child, I spent a whole week eating thousand-year candy.
Nene:
Labor Thanksgiving Day. People who work are amazing, aren't they？
Nene:
When you hear "Culture Festival," what do you associate it with？
Nene
Winter vacation is coming soon. There are so many events, right？
Nene
The longest night of the year. Do you like pumpkins？
Nene
Today is the Emperor's birthday. I wonder how it feels to be celebrated all over Japan？
Nene
Winter vacation starts today. It's exciting, isn't it？
Nene
Christmas Eve night feels a bit thrilling, doesn't it？ Are you feeling the same？
Nene
Hehe. Today is Christmas Eve. Of course, you're thinking about something, right？
Nene
Christmas Eve night feels romantic…… Hehe. I wonder if it will snow.
Nene
Thank you for everything this year. Let's have a great year ahead too.
Nene
Studying is going well…… probably.
Nene
Finally…… I was so lonely, I almost cried.
Nene
Oh, it's been a while. ……Please come to see me more often!
Nene
I'm glad you came. Don't leave me alone like this anymore, okay？
Nene
I thought you had forgotten about me…… It's not true, right？
Nene
Leaving me alone like this, neglecting your girlfriend. Don't you think you deserve some punishment？
Nene
Ah, you came. I was worried, you know？
Nene
Huh……？ Again？ No, I'm happy.
Nene
You really like me that much？
Nene
Oh, again？ Really？
Nene
You came again, what's up？
Nene
You keep coming to see me so many times.
Nene
Ah…… What are we going to do today？
Nene
Hehe, you came again.
Nene
It's almost time…… No, it's about something else.
Nene
Almost…… Yes, let's do our best. Hehe, it's a secret what it is.
Nene
We met again, didn't we？
Nene
I was hoping we could meet again.
Nene
What have you been up to since then？
Nene
It's starting soon, so don't rush, okay？
Nene
Sorry. I'm feeling a bit excited for some reason.
Nene
Ah, you're here…… Yeah, I see.
Nene
I've been waiting for you. Just kidding.
Nene
Wait a moment, please. I'll go get ready.
Nene
I see…… You came to see me.
Nene
You wanted to see me？ Hehe.
Nene
Hehe, you don't have to force yourself to come see me.
Nene
Hehe, were you lonely？
Nene
We'll be together all day today, right？
Nene
I also…… wanted to see you, I guess？ Ahaha.
Nene
Ehehe. I've been waiting.
Nene
Geez. You made me wait too long.
Nene
Ah, you're here. Ehe, welcome.
Nene
You know…… I've missed you.
Nene
Huh, oh, wait a moment.
Nene
We met again. Just being able to meet you makes me happy.
Nene
Welcome back. Shall we have a meal？ Or take a bath？ I just wanted to say it, hehe.
